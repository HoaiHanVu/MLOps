# Predictive Machine Learning Model Deployment using Docker and FastAPI
## Introduction
This repository demonstrates a streamlined approach to deploy a predictive machine learning model using Docker and FastAPI. By following the instructions provided, you will be able to containerize the model and create a FastAPI for real-time predictions.
## Features
- Docker: The project utilizes Docker to ensure seamless deployment across different environments, eliminating dependency issues and simplifying the setup process.
- FastAPI: FastAPI is a high-performance web framework for building APIs in Python. It enables rapid development and effortless integration with the machine learning model.
- Machine Learning Model: The repository includes a sample machine learning model, ready to be deployed. However, it can be easily replaced with your own trained model by following the provided guidelines.
## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install Docker on your system if it is not already installed.
3. Navigate to the project directory and build the Docker image using the provided Dockerfile.
4. Once the image is built, create a Docker container and run it.
5. (Optional) Access the FastAPI Swagger UI interface to interact with the API and make predictions.
